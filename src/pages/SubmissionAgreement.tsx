            <p>This SUBMISSION AGREEMENT ("Submission Agreement") shall govern the submission of
scripts, (collectively, the "Material") submitted by you ("Writer") to LLCSet in Stone
Productions ("Company") and ("Producer"). For good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which Writer acknowledges, by opting-in to the Program, Writer hereby
irrevocably agrees as follows: Representation and Warranty: Writer represents and warrants (i) that Writer meets the submission
eligibility requirements posted on the Company's website, and (ii) that Writer is the sole author
and owner of the Material (or a member of a team of writers who is the sole author and owner of
the Material), and that Writer has the power and authority to submit the Material to Company on
the terms hereof without the consent of any other party. Writer agrees to indemnify Company and
Producer against any liabilities, losses, claims, demands, costs (including reasonable attorneys'
fees), or expenses arising in connection with Writer's breach or alleged breach of the foregoing.</p>

            <p>2. Review of Material: Writer acknowledges that the only obligation undertaken by Company and
Producer in consideration of Writer's submission is to accept the material for review and to
review if and to the extent Company and Producer deem appropriate. No other obligation or duty
on Company's and Producer's part shall arise from or be implied by this submission. Without
limiting the foregoing, Writer understands that Company and Producer are under no obligation
whatsoever to select Writer for the Program.</p>

            <p>3. Writer's Commitments. Writer will provide any additional information requested by Company
and Producer, including a one-page personal biography, and Writer's contact information and
Writer consents to Company and Producer sharing such material with third parties to the extent
appropriate in connection with the Program. In the event that Writer is selected by Producer to
participate in the Program, Writer grants Company and Producer the right to use Writer's name,
likeness and biography in connection with the Program, including, without limitation, in
connection with promotional materials for future iterations of the Program.</p>

            <p>4. Use of Material; Release: Writer understands that Company and Producer have access to and/or
may develop or have developed materials and ideas which may be similar or identical to the
Material in theme, idea, plot, format or other respects. Writer agrees that Writer will not be
entitled to any compensation because of the use of any such similar or identical material which
may have been independently created by Company or Producer or may have come to Company or
Producer from any other independent source. Writer acknowledges that Company and Producer
are not agreeing to refrain from, or to compensate Writer for, the use of any elements of the
Material which are not protected by copyright laws, including, by way of illustration, ideas,
historical or factual matters or other public domain elements or aspects of the Material. The
foregoing shall apply whether or not Company and Producer have obtained such ideas and/or
other public domain elements from other sources. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained
in this Submission Agreement, nor the fact of Writer's submission of the Material to Company
and Producer, shall be deemed to place Company or Producer in any different position than any
other member of the public to whom Writer has not submitted said Material with respect to any
portion of the Material that does not constitute protectable literary property. Except as otherwise
provided in this Submission Agreement, Writer hereby releases Company and Producer from any
and all claims, demands and liabilities of every kind whatsoever, know or unknown, that may
arise in relation to the Material or by reason of any claim now or hereafter made by Writer that</p>

            <div className="text-center my-4">Page 2</div>

            <p>Company or Producer have used or appropriated the Material, except for fraud or willful
misconduct on the part of Company or Producer. Writer agrees to indemnify Company and
Producer against any liabilities, losses, claims, demands, costs (including reasonable attorneys'
fees), or expenses arising in connection with Writer's breach or alleged breach of the foregoing.
All references in this paragraph to Company and Producer shall include Company's and
Producer's respective employees, officers, directors, board members, advisory board members,
organization members, program judges, independent contractors, agents, representatives,
affiliates, licensees, successors, assigns and any person to whom Company or Producer have
given access to the Material, all of whom shall be deemed third party beneficiaries of this
Submission Agreement.</p>

            <p>WRITER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE/SHE IS FAMILIAR WITH THE PROVISIONS OF
CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS:</p>

            <p className="italic">"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR
RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR
AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER,
WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE
DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY."</p>

            <p>WRITER, BEING AWARE OF SAID CODE SECTION, HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHTS HE/SHE MAY HAVE THEREUNDER, AS WELL AS UNDER ANY OTHER
STATUTES OR COMMON LAW PRINCIPLES OF SIMILAR EFFECT.</p>

            <p>5. Return of Material: Company and Producer may, but shall not be obligated to, return Writer's
Material to Writer, but Company and Producer shall not be liable in any way if it is lost,
misplaced, stolen or destroyed.</p>

            <p>6. Arbitration: If there is any dispute arising out of this agreement, or the Program, including a
dispute about the validity, operation, meaning or breach hereof (including, for example, if
Company and/or Producer should determine that they have the right to use material without
entering into a further agreement with Writer, and Writer disagrees with their determination), the
dispute between the parties (the "Dispute") shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration,
which shall constitute the sole dispute resolution mechanism hereunder and Writer irrevocably
waives any rights to seek other relief at law or equity. The arbitration shall be controlled by the
terms of this agreement, on an individual and not class basis only, and any award favorable to
Writer shall be limited to the fixing of compensation for Company and/or Producer's use of the
submitted material, which shall bear a reasonable relation to compensation normally paid by
Company and/or to persons of Writer's present stature and experience for Company and/or
Producer's use of similar material. The arbitration shall be initiated and conducted according to
the JAMS Streamlined (for claims under $250,000) Arbitration Rules and Procedures, except as
modified herein, including the Optional Appeal Procedure, at the Los Angeles office of JAMS, or
its successor ("JAMS") in effect at the time the request for arbitration is made (the "Arbitration
Rules"). The arbitration shall be conducted in Los Angeles County before a single neutral
arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator shall follow
California law and the Federal Rules of Evidence in adjudicating the Dispute. The parties waive
the right to seek punitive damages and the arbitrator shall have no authority to award such
damages.</p>

            <p>WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, WRITER
UNDERSTANDS THAT WRITER IS WAIVING A RIGHT TO A TRIAL, TO SEEK AN</p>

            <div className="text-center my-4">Page 2</div>

            <p>INJUNCTION OR TO ANY OTHER RELIEF OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED
FOR IN THIS SECTION.</p>

            <p>7. Assignment: Company and Producer shall have the right to assign this Submission Agreement
and this Submission Agreement shall inure to the benefit of Company's and Producer's
successors and assigns.</p>

            <p>8. Miscellaneous. This Submission Agreement shall be governed exclusively by the laws of
California without regard to conflict of laws provisions. Should any provision or part of any
provision be void or unenforceable, such provision or part thereof shall be deemed omitted and
this Submission Agreement with such provision or part thereof omitted shall remain in full force
and effect. This Submission Agreement shall at all times be construed as to carry out the
purposes hereof. This Submission Agreement represents the complete agreement between Writer
and Company and Producer regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or
contemporaneous negotiations, agreements, representations or undertakings. Any modification or
waiver of any of the provisions of this Submission Agreement must be in writing and signed by
both parties.</p>
